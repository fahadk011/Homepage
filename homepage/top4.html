      Central Park is New York's backyard. This lush 843-acre patch of nature in the <br> middle of Manhattan is one of the city's biggest attractions and greatest assets,<br> enjoyed by tourists and locals year-round. Countless scenes from movies and<br> TV
      shows have been filmed here over the years. The park is home to scenic hills;<br> meadows; playgrounds; skating rinks; ball fields; and many well-known attractions,<br> including Strawberry Fields, Belvedere Castle, and the Central Park Zoo. Be warned;
      <br>the park is huge. The best way to explore it is to stop by the visitor center and pick up<br> a map of Central Park showing the various attractions and things to do, and then plan <br> out a walking route or take a tour.

        Junoon, “passion” in Hindi, delivers on the promise of its moniker with an authentic,<br> yet elegantly modern take on Indian cuisine. Restaurateur Rajesh Bhardwaj, inspired<br> to share his love for the food and culture of his native India, assembled a
        talented team<br> to create a world-class restaurant that would re-define how Indian cuisine is presented<br> on the international gastronomic stage. A restaurant that is the recipient of a prestigious <br>Michelin star the year it opened and has earned the same
        coveted award every year since <br>its 2010 debut. The team shares a vision of the future for Indian cuisine, an endeavor <br>to improve the purest traditional and regional cuisines, while simultaneously creating <br>innovative, modern dishes and interpretation.
        Our passion is a contemporary restaurant <br>offering dining experiences to satisfy all aspects of fine cuisine, in a vibrant and trendsetting <br>ambience. Junoon is a place of gathering, a place of celebration, <br>a place for business and a place for pleasure.
